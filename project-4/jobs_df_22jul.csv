506,NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SINGAPORE,Postdoctoral Fellow / Research Associate – Lamina Cribrosa Biomechanics: A Diagnostic Biomarker for Gl,21 LOWER KENT RIDGE ROAD 119077,"Contract, Full Time",Non-executive,"Education and Training, Engineering","$5,000to$6,500","Roles & ResponsibilitiesJob description: We are looking for a bright, dynamic, and highly motivated individual to perform research in translational biomechanics with applications to ophthalmology. For more information about our Laboratory, please visit: http://www.bioeng.nus.edu.sg/oeil/.   The proposed study aims to assess the biomechanics of the lamina cribrosa (LC) in vivo. The lamina cribrosa (LC), at the back of the eye, provides mechanical supports to the axons that pass through and transmit visual information to the brain. Because the LC is porous, it is mechanically weak, and is the major site of axonal damage in glaucoma – the most common cause of irreversible blindness. Throughout the day and night, the LC is exposed to three major loads: the intraocular pressure (IOP; pushing the LC posteriorly), the cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP; pushing the LC anteriorly), and during eye movements, by the traction from the optic nerve distorting the LC. We believe that excessive and cumulative deformations of the LC from any of these loads could result in glaucomatous axonal damage. We also believe that the biomechanical behaviour of the LC is different between healthy and glaucoma subjects, and that accurate in vivo measurements of LC biomechanics could help us better diagnose glaucoma.   For this project, the successful candidate will use, improve and develop 3D image processing algorithms to assess the biomechanics of the LC in response to changes in IOP, CSFP and gaze position in a large population of normal and glaucoma patients (imaged under various conditions with 3D optical coherence tomography).   The candidate will also assess how information about LC biomechanics could be used to better understand and diagnose glaucoma. This will be done using custom artificial intelligence (deep learning) algorithms in collaboration with the OCTAGON team (http://www.bioeng.nus.edu.sg/OEIL/OCTAGON.html). Finally, the candidate will also be expected to provide assistance while patients are being imaged.   This is a project in collaboration with the Singapore Eye Research Institute (top 5 eye institute worldwide).","RequirementsQualification: Excellent programming skills (in C++ and Matlab/Python) and knowledge of 3D image tracking techniques (e.g. digital volume correlation) are required. The candidate is also expected to have a strong foundation in nonlinear continuum mechanics and finite element modeling. Knowledge of the Virtual Fields Method, code parallelization, optical coherence tomography, and deep learning is considered a plus. Hands-on experience in mechanical or biomechanical testing is also considered a plus. No background in ophthalmology is required. Candidates with PhD in Biomedical Engineering, Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, or other related disciplines are encouraged to apply.   Earliest Starting Date: July 2018.   Duration: 3 years.     To apply, please email a detailed CV and the names of two references to:   Dr. Michael JA Girard Ophthalmic Engineering & Innovation Laboratory Department of Biomedical Engineering National University of Singapore Email: jobs@invivobiomechanics.com Homepage: http://www.bioeng.nus.edu.sg/oeil/"

The roles offered are related to investigation, implementation, and analysis for a new research project awarded by the International Design Centre Singapore, initially a two-year program. Project Description This project focuses on if data-visualisation for use in a design context, could be best tackled from a 'decision first' point of view. Developing design approaches and tools for industry which support the act of decision making. This is in contrast to a 'data first' approach where the visualisations used are dictated by the most appropriate way to show the data but what is done with that data is ignored. The hypnosis is that actionable data-visualisation is inherently different and requires research to improve it as well as new interaction platforms to support good approaches. The research is interdisciplinary anchored in Architecture, Structural Engineering and Geography/Planning domains by, Sam Joyce [SUTD] (principal investigator), Caitlin Muller [MIT], and Ate Poorthuis [SUTD] respectively all with industry, software and research experience. The spatial, visual, analytical and subjective nature of these disciplines makes them uniquely interesting when considering how design decisions are made. Typically, with buildings, masterplans, and government initiatives there are a complex set of stakeholders with executive power. This project aims to research and consider what types of visualisations are required to provide the best insight to help these people make these decisions.   Job Description We are keen to take on someone who is enthusiastic about design and data visualisation.

The role will involve design and implementation of the experiments and subsequent analysis and exposition. Ensuring analytics rigor but also uncovering trends and relationships. Development of webserver services to aid designers on decision making based on the recommendations in the initial research. This may involve a full user system but also a web framework to help designers easily implement these approaches into their workflows.

Our strategic thrusts are in the spheres of intelligence, communications and media and our research capabilities are in shared sensor networks, public-public/public-private data-sharing platform, big data analytics and visualisation solutions. For more information about I²R, please visit www.i2r.a-star.edu.sg Neuromorphic computing is a rapidly evolving field that aims to develop brain-inspired intelligence by neural modelling and to implement such computing in neuromorphic circuits for applications such as robotics, IOT sensors and wearables. One of our major targets is to develop spike-based computing and learning algorithms which are able to support deep learning architecture and on-chip realization. Subsequently, such solution will be implemented on an application demonstrator that showcases the strength of the proposed system. The candidate will be involved in the project where the main objective is for neuromorphic algorithm inspired from recent development in deep learning, software realization and its use in the application demonstrator.   Candidates are required to have good knowledge or interest in one or more of the following areas:  Neuromorphic coding: Investigate how to represent information with spikes in an optimal way and interface the sensor with the neuromorphic chip    Learning: Investigate how deep learning structure can be efficiently computed using spikes and explore how such converted structure can be trained. Adapt and realize the learning algorithms into a form that is suitable for hardware implementation    System integration and applications: Integrate different computational principles into a system and apply it to solve tasks that showcase the strength of the proposed system ","Requirements PhD in Machine Learning, Computer Science/Engineering, Neural Science, or related fields Possess experience in machine learning, neural network computation, or spiking neuronal computation Strong software and algorithm development skills with MATLAB, Python, C/C++ Experience with GPU, FPGA and/or other Neuromorphic related implementation Documentation knowledge in system engineering, machine learning, neural networks, information processing, or system design and realization Strong team work ethic, with excellent interpersonal skill   The above eligibility criteria are not exhaustive.
